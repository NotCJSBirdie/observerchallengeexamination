/*
	In order to accomplish this task, you are supposed to do the following:

	Make it working so that clicking on any of buttons leads to "Counter"
	label being up to date in both instances of a component.

	Current behavior: you click on button #2, both label #1 and label #2 stay
	the same and display the old value of a counter. Basically, nothing happens.

	Desired behavior: you click on button #2, and both label #1 and label #2 now
	display a relevant value of a counter.
